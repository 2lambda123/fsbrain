In this document, we demonstrate some high-level functions for loading and analysing structural neuroimaging data preprocessed with [FreeSurfer](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu). FreeSurfer stores its output in a directory structure with fixed subfolder names. This package implements several high-level functions that allow the user to access surface-based brain structure data for large groups of subjects with very little code. It also supports the computation of statistics for individual brain structures or brain atlas regions for brain morphometry measures. Statistical analysis can then be performed using standard methods implemented in other packages.

Note: While this packages provides an abstract access layer to neuroimaging data, it does *not* implement file readers. It uses the 'freesurferformats' package in the background to parse the file formats.

## Accessing morphometry data for groups of subjects


To open a single file directly, all you would need is 'freesurferformats':

```{r, eval = FALSE}
    library("freesurferformats");
    cortical_thickness = read.fs.morph("study_dir/subject1/surf/lh.thickness");
```


### Native space

The nitools package provides a high-level interface to access data for groups of subjects. Here, we compute the mean thickness for each subject in native space:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
    library("nitools");
    subjects_dir = path.expand("~/data/study1")
    subjects_list = c("subject1", "subject2", "subject3", "subject4", "subject5")
    mean_thickness_lh = group.morph.agg.native(subjects_dir, subjects_list, "thickness", "lh", agg_fun=mean)
```


### Standard space

Here, we compute the mean thickness for each subject in standard space:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
    library("nitools");
    subjects_dir = path.expand("~/data/study1")
    subjects_list = c("subject1", "subject2", "subject3", "subject4", "subject5")
    mean_thickness_lh = group.morph.agg.standard(subjects_dir, subjects_list, "thickness", "lh", fwhm="10", agg_fun=mean)
```


## Aggregating over atlas regions

When working with native space data for groups, vertex-wise comparison is not possible and one if often interested in aggregating data or summary statistics. Obtaining these for a group becomes easy with 'nitools':


```{r, eval = FALSE}
  subjects_dir = file.path("study_dir")
  subjects_list = c("subject1", "subject2", "subject3")  # You may want to read them from a subjects file instead if you have many
  data = group.multimorph.agg.native(subjects_dir, subjects_list, c("thickness", "area", "volume"), c("lh", "rh"), agg_fun = mean);
```

This gives you a dataframe that contains the following columns:

* `subject_id`
* `hemi`
* `measure_name`
* `measure_value`

The measure values are the mean thickness/area/volume over all vertices of the subject, computed from the respective native space morphometry files (e.g., 'subject1/surf/lh.thickness', 'subject2/surf/lh.thickness', and so on).

Note that you can get short format by setting 'cast = FALSE', which will result in a dataframe with the following columns instead:

* `subject_id`
* `lh.thickness`
* `rh.thickness`
* `lh.area`
* `eh.area`
* `lh.volume`
* `rh.volume`

You could do the same in standard space with `group.multimorph.agg.native()`, even though it's not very common.


## Mapping one result value to each brain atlas region

Mapping a single value to an atlas region of a subject (usually a template subject like fsaverage) is useful to display results, like p values or effect sizes, on the brain surface. Here is an example script that uses nitools to do that:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library("nitools")

hemi = "lh"               # 'lh' or 'rh'
atlas = "aparc"           # an atlas, e.g., 'aparc', 'aparc.a2009s', 'aparc.DKTatlas'

template_subjects_dir = "/Applications/freesurfer/subjects";    # Some directory where we can find fsaverage. This can be omitted if FREESURFER_HOME is set, the function will find fsaverage in there by default.

# One can also retrieve all region names of an atlas. This would get all 36 aparc regions:
region_names_aparc = nitools::get.atlas.region.names('aparc', template_subjects_dir=template_subjects_dir);
region_value_list = as.list(rnorm(length(region_names_aparc), mean=5, sd=1.5)); # assign some random normal values for this example. One would put effect size values or whatever here. The order of values has to match the order of the region names.
names(region_value_list) = region_names_aparc;    # Assign the names to the values.

ret = nitools::fs.write.region.values.fsaverage(hemi, atlas, region_value_list, output_file="/tmp/spread.mgz", template_subjects_dir=template_subjects_dir, show_freeview_tip=TRUE);
```

This code will write an MGZ file that can be visualized in FreeView or Matlab/Surfstat.


## Rendering surfaces and data in GNU R for a quick preview

You can visualize data directly in GNU R in different ways. If you want an interactive 3-dimensional view of the brain surface, use the `rgl` package. It's a simple mesh renderer that uses an OpenGL backend. It's fast enough to draw meshes with > 300.000 vertices even on old laptops. The `rgl` package is not a dependency of `nitools`, so you'll have to install it.

Let's first load a mesh and an annotation:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library("freesurferformats");   # a dependency of nitools, so you have it already
library("rgl");

sample_subject_dir = file.path(Sys.getenv("FREESURFER_HOME"), "subjects", "bert");       # or whatever you prefer

surf = read.fs.surface(file.path(sample_subject_dir, "surf", "lh.white"));
annot = read.fs.annot(file.path(sample_subject_dir, "label", "lh.aparc.annot"));
```

Now we can render:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
mesh = tmesh3d(unlist(surf$vertices), unlist(surf$faces), homogeneous=FALSE);
rgl.open();
col = annot$hex_colors_rgb;
wire3d(mesh, col=col, meshcolor="vertices");
```

This will give you an interactive window in which you can freely rotate a view similar to the one shown in the following screenshot:

You could also visualize cortical thickness (continuing the example from above):

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ct = read.fs.morph(file.path(sample_subject_dir, "surf", "lh.thickness"))   # Load some data to visualize, cortical thickness here
library(squash); # for colormap functions
col_ct = cmap(ct, map = makecmap(ct, colFn = jet));  # apply 'jet' colormap to data
wire3d(mesh, col=col_ct, meshcolor="vertices");
```

If you prefer a 2D view that shows brain regions from different viewports in cartoon style, you may want to try the `ggseg` package instead.

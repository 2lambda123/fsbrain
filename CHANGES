fsbrain Changes
===============

Version 0.3.0
-------------
- Fix reading standard space data from template subjects other than fsaverage
- Add new cbry colormap and related mkco.cluster function, great for visualizing clusters


Version 0.2.1
-------------
- Fix a bug in colorbar drawing that lead to wrong colors (see #6)
- Change defaults in functions for drawing a separate colorbar and combining it with arranged images
- Support combining both horizontal and vertical cbars with a brainview image
- Suggest viridis and RColorBrewer packages for great colors, use them if available


Version 0.2.0
-------------
- Breaking: move rotate3D and flid3D function to freesurferformats. To update your code, replace fsbrain::rotate3D with freesurferformats::rotate3D.
- Support export of coloredmeshes to PLY format
- Add new vignette, a Frequently Askes Questions (FAQ) format
- Add R notebook with code and live examples (web)
- Improve documentation in docstrings
- Improve colormap computation and handling, especially drawing of colorbars
- Remove plyr dependendency, require freesurferformats 0.1.10
- The 'colormap' argument to all vis functions is deprecated, use makecmap_options instead. See the vis function docs for an example.


Version 0.1.0
-------------
- Add many new volume manipulation and rendering functions, e.g., lightbox view in volvis.lightbox
- Support cortex_only parameter also in morph concat functions
- Fix bug #2: cortex_only parameter was ignored by group.agg.morph.native and group.agg.morph.standard
- Add subject.mask function to compute medial wall mask (or other masks) for a subject


Version 0.0.3
-------------
- Add function to visualize arbitrary vertices and label data (vis.labeldata.on.subject) and a function to compute the neighbors of a vertex (mesh.vertex.neighbors)
- The vis.data.on.subject function now accepts a character string for the lh_morphdata and rh_morphdata arguments. If a string, it is treated as a filepath and the data is loaded from that file.
- Add the logical parameter 'cortex_only' to various native space morphometry functions (including subject.morph.native, group.morph.native, group.morph.agg.native na group.multimorph.agg.native). When set to TRUE, this parameter will limit the data to vertices which are part of the cortex (as defined by the label file label//h.cortex.label for the respective subject). This allows one to ignore the data from the medial wall in all of these functions.
- Also add 'cortex_only' parameter for the equivalent standard space functions and the morphometry visualization functions.
- Add more examples to various functions, extend the vignette with latest changes and new functionality.
- Remove unused dependencies
- Add function vislayout.from.coloredmeshes which allows one to create a tight layout visualization from arbitrary angle sets


Version 0.0.2
--------------
- Support rglactions and rgloptions to conveniently increase output resolution and create screenshots
- Scale colormaps over several meshes where appropriate. This ensures that the same color in the left and right hemisphere represents the exact same data value.
- Improve doc strings of many functions
- Add helper function to clip data at percentile (clip.data)
- Require freesurferformats version >= 0.1.4 for surface loading fix, adapt mesh visualization to fix
- Introduce masks
- Add functions to visualize labels (vis.subject.label) and masks (vis.mask.on.subject)
- Tons of work on the vignette


Version 0.0.1
--------------
- First release submitted to CRAN.

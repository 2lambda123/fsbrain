# fsbrain volume visualization

These are brain volume visualizations created using the [fsbrain R package](https://github.com/dfsp-spirit/fsbrain/).

## Lightbox views

A lightbox showing every 5th frame of a T1W volume, sagittal plane. A bounding box has been computed, so that empty space around the brain has been clipped automatically:

![Visvolume](https://github.com/dfsp-spirit/fsbrain_gallery/raw/master/volume/lightbox_axis1.png?raw=true "Lightbox view of a brain volume, rendered with fsbrain")

The same can be done for the [axial](https://github.com/dfsp-spirit/fsbrain_gallery/raw/master/volume/lightbox_axis2.png) and [coronal](https://github.com/dfsp-spirit/fsbrain_gallery/raw/master/volume/lightbox_axis3.png) planes.

You can also add activation data, p-values, or whatever, as an overlay.

## Voxel-based 3D renderings

Coming soon.


## Animations

You can also render the volume slices into an animation. The result looks like this:

![Visvolumeanim](https://github.com/dfsp-spirit/fsbrain_gallery/raw/master/volume/animations/MRI_T1w_ax1.gif?raw=true "Animation in sagittal view, rendered with fsbrain")

The same can be done for the [axial](https://github.com/dfsp-spirit/fsbrain_gallery/raw/master/volume/animations/MRI_T1w_ax2.gif) and [coronal](https://github.com/dfsp-spirit/fsbrain_gallery/raw/master/volume/animations/MRI_T1w_ax3.gif) planes.

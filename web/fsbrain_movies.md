# fsbrain movies

These are movies created using the [fsbrain R package](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=fsbrain), with a lot of help from [rgl](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rgl) and some polish from [ezgif](http://ezgif.com).

**Movie 1:** Rotating visualization of mean curvature plotted onto the white surface of a subject (native space).

\title{Pre-compute geodesic neighborhood for all vertices of the surfaces.}
\usage{
spotlight.neighborhoods.gd(surfaces, distance = 5)
}
\arguments{
\item{surfaces}{fs.surface instance or a \code{\link[fsbrain]{hemilist}} of the latter.}

\item{distance}{the distance defining the neighborhood. The neighborhoods never cross hemispheres.}
}
\description{
Pre-compute geodesic neighborhood for all vertices of the surfaces.
}
\note{
This function requires a Github version of the optional dependency package 'Rvcg'. It is highly experimental and should not be considered part of the official API.

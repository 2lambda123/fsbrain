\title{Retrieve label data for a single subject.}
\usage{
subject.label(subjects_dir, subject_id, label, hemi,
  return_one_based_indices = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{subjects_dir, }{string. The FreeSurfer SUBJECTS_DIR, i.e., a directory containing the data for all your subjects, each in a subdir named after the subject identifier.}

\item{subject_id, }{string. The subject identifier}

\item{label, }{string. Name of the label file, without the hemi part (if any), but including the '.label' suffix. E.g., 'cortex.label' for '?h.cortex.label'}

\item{hemi, }{string, one of 'lh' or 'rh'. The hemisphere name. Used to construct the names of the label data files to be loaded.}

\item{return_one_based_indices, }{logical. Whether the indices should be 1-based. Indices are stored zero-based in the file, but R uses 1-based indices. Defaults to TRUE, which means that 1 will be added to all indices read from the file before returning them.}
}
\value{
vector with label data: the list of vertex indices in the label.
}
\description{
Load a label (like 'label/lh.cortex.label') for a subject from disk. Uses knowledge about the FreeSurfer directory structure to load the correct file.

\title{Aggregate standard space (fsaverage) morphometry data over one hemisphere for a group of subjects.}
\usage{
group.morph.agg.standard(subjects_dir, subjects_list, measure, hemi, fwhm,
  agg_fun = mean, template_subject = "fsaverage", format = "mgh")
}
\arguments{
\item{subjects_dir, }{string. The FreeSurfer SUBJECTS_DIR, i.e., a directory containing the data for all your subjects, each in a subdir named after the subject identifier.}

\item{subjects_list, }{string vector. A vector of subject identifiers that match the directory names within subjects_dir.}

\item{measure, }{string. Name of the vertex-wise measure of morphometry data file. E.g., "area" or "thickness". Used to construct the name of the morphometry file to be loaded.}

\item{hemi, }{string, one of 'lh' or 'rh'. The hemisphere name. Used to construct the names of the annotation and morphometry data files to be loaded.}

\item{fwhm, }{string. Smoothing as string, e.g. '10' or '25'.}

\item{agg_fun, }{function. An R function that aggregates data, typically max, mean, min or something similar. Note: this is NOT a string, put the function name without quotes. Defaults to mean.}

\item{template_subject, }{string. Template subject name, defaults to 'fsaverage'.}

\item{format, }{string. One of 'mgh', 'mgz', 'curv'. Defaults to 'mgh'.}
}
\value{
dataframe with aggregated values for all subjects, with 2 columns and n rows, where n is the number of subjects. The 2 columns are 'subject_id' and 'value', the latter contains the aggregated data.

\title{Create a binary mask from labels.}
\usage{
mask.from.labeldata.for.hemi(labels, num_vertices_in_hemi,
  invert_labels = FALSE, existing_mask = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{labels, }{list of labels. A label is just a vector of vertex indices. It can be created manually, but is typically loaded from a label file using [fsbrain::subject.label].}

\item{num_vertices_in_hemi, }{integer. The number of vertices of the surface for which the mask is created. This must be for a single hemisphere.}

\item{invert_labels}{logical, whether to invert the label data.}

\item{existing_mask}{an existing mask to modify or NULL. If it is NULL, a new mask will be created before applying any labels, and the values set during initialization of this new mask are the negation of the 'invert_label' parameter. Defaults to NULL.}
}
\value{
logical vector. The mask. It contains a logical value for each vertex. By default, the vertex indices from the labels are FALSE and the rest are TRUE, but this can be changed with the parameter 'invert_labels'.
}
\description{
Create a binary mask for the data of a single hemisphere from one or more labels. A label contains the vertex indices which are part of it, but often having a mask in more convenient.

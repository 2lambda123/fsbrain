\title{Compute all vertices in given distance on a sphere and their distances.}
\usage{
surf.sphere.dist(spherical_surface, maxdist)
}
\arguments{
\item{spherical_surface}{an fs.surface instance representing the spherical version (\code{lh.sphere} or \code{rh.sphere} of the subject).}

\item{maxdist}{double, the neighborhood size (or maximal distance to travel along the sphere when searching for neighbors). TODO: find out proper value for this.}
}
\description{
Compute all vertices in given distance on a sphere and their distances.
}
\note{
see MRISgaussianWeights to get Gaussian weights for the vertex neighborhoods
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
spherical_surface = subject.surface(fsaverage.path(), "fsaverage3", surface="sphere", hemi="lh");
dist = surf.sphere.dist(spherical_surface, 5.0);
highlight.vertices.on.subject(fsaverage.path(), "fsaverage3", verts_lh = dist$neigh[[500]], surface="sphere")
}

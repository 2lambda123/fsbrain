\item{subject_id, }{string. The subject identifier}

\item{measure, }{string. Name of the vertex-wise measure of morphometry data file. E.g., "area" or "thickness". Used to construct the name of the morphometry file to be loaded.}

\item{hemi, }{string, one of 'lh' or 'rh'. The hemisphere name. Used to construct the names of the annotation and morphometry data files to be loaded.}

\item{format, }{string. One of 'mgh', 'mgz', 'curv'. Defaults to 'mgh'.}

\value{
vector with native space morph data
}

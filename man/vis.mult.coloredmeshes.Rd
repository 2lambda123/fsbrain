\title{Visualize a list of colored meshes from several angles. Test function, will be removed.}
\usage{
vis.mult.coloredmeshes(coloredmeshes, background = "white",
  skip_all_na = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{coloredmeshes, }{list of coloredmesh. A coloredmesh is a named list as returned by the coloredmesh.from.* functions. It has the entries 'mesh' of type tmesh3d, a 'col', which is a color specification for such a mesh.}

\item{background}{string, background color passed to rgl::bg3d()}

\item{skip_all_na}{logical, whether to skip (i.e., not render) meshes in the list that have the property 'morph_data_was_all_na' set to TRUE. Defaults to TRUE. Practically, this means that a hemisphere for which the data was not given is not rendered, instead of being rendered in a single color.}

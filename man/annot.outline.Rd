\title{Compute outline vertex colors from annotation.}
\usage{
annot.outline(annotdata, surface_mesh, background = "white")
}
\arguments{
\item{surface_mesh}{brain surface mesh, as returned by functions like \code{\link[fsbrain]{subject.surface}}.}

\item{background}{color, the background color to assign to the non-border parts of the regions. Defaults to 'white'.}

\item{annot}{an annotation, as returned by functions like \code{\link[fsbrain]{subject.annot}}.}
}
\value{
vector of colors, one color for each mesh vertex
}
\description{
For each region in an atlas, compute the outer border and color the respective vertices in the region-specific color from the annot's colortable.
}

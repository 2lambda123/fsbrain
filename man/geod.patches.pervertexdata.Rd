\title{Generate per-vertex distance data from geodesic patches around several vertices.}
\usage{
geod.patches.pervertexdata(mesh, vertex, ...)
}
\value{
vector of doubles (or a hemilist of 2 such vectors if 'mesh' is a hemilist), the per-vertex distance data. Data for vertices outside neighborhoods will be NA.
}
\description{
Works across hemispheres (for a whole brain) if you pass a hemilist of meshes as parameter 'mesh', see below.

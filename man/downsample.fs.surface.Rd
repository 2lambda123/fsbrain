\title{Downsample a FreeSurfer mesh, e.g. from ico7 to ico6 resolution.}
\usage{
downsample.fs.surface(surface, ntarget = 6L)
}
\arguments{
\item{surface}{an fs.surface instance, must originate from a FreeSurfer brain mesh.}

\item{ntarget}{scalar integer in range 2..6, the ico order. Must be smaller than the ico order of the input 'surface'.}
}
\value{
the downsampled surface
}
\description{
Reduce the number of vertices and faces in a mesh. Only works if the mesh has been created in the special way FreeSurfer does it. This will NOT work for arbitrary meshes.

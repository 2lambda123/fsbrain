\title{Compute 3D boundary box of a volume.}
\usage{
vol.boundary.box(volume)
}
\arguments{
\item{volume}{a 3D image volume}
}
\value{
named list with 2 entries: `from` is an integer vector of length 3, defining the minimal (x,y,z) foreground indices. `to` is an integer vector of length 3, defining the maximal (x,y,z) foreground indices.
}
\description{
Compute the bounding box of a 3D volume, i.e. the inner foreground area that must be retained if you want to remove all background from the corners of the volume. The foreground is determined by thresholding, such that all values greate than 0 are considered foreground. See \code{\link[fsbrain]{vol.boundary.mask}} for details.

\title{Get indices of the axes defining the given plane.}
\usage{
vol.plane.axes(plane_name)
}
\arguments{
\item{plane_name}{string, one of "axial", "coronal", or "sagittal". If this is an integer vector of length 2 already, it is returned as given. If it is a single integer, it is interpreted as an axis index, and the plane orthogonal to the axis is returned.}
}
\value{
integer vector of length 2, the axes indices.
}
\description{
This function assumes that the volume is in the standard FreeSurfer orientation, as returned by reading a volume with functions like \code{\link[fsbrain]{subject.volume}}.

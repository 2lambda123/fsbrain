\title{Convert intensity image to colors.}
\usage{
vol.intensity.to.color(volume)
}
\arguments{
\item{volume}{numeric array, typically a 3D image with intensities in range [0, 1]}
}
\value{
array of RGB color strings.
}
\description{
Convert a gray-scale image defined by intensity values in range [0, 1] to an image with identical dimensions that contains an R color string (like `#222222`) at each position. The color strings are computed from the intensities, by taking the intensity value as the value for all three RGB channels. I.e., the output is still gray-scale, but defined in RGB space. To make it clear, this function does **not** apply a colormap.

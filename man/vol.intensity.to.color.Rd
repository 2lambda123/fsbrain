\title{Convert integer intensity image to RGB color string form.}
\usage{
vol.intensity.to.color(volume)
}
\arguments{
\item{volume}{numeric array, typically a 3D image with intensities in range [0, 1]. This function now also supports numeric matrices (2D images, slices) and numeric vectors (1D).}
}
\value{
array (or matrix, or vector) of RGB color strings. All of them will represent gray values.
}
\description{
Convert a gray-scale image defined by intensity values in range [0, 1] to an image with identical dimensions that contains an R color string (like `#222222`) at each position. The color strings are computed from the intensities, by taking the intensity value as the value for all three RGB channels. I.e., the output is still gray-scale, but defined in RGB space. To make it clear, this function does **not** apply a colormap. It only changes the representation of the data, not the resulting colors.
}
\examples{
   vol.intensity.to.color(c(0.0, 0.5, 1.0));
   # output: "#000000" "#808080" "#FFFFFF"

\title{Voxel-based visualization of volume mask.}
\usage{
volvis.voxels(volume, max_render = 25000, render_every = 8)
}
\arguments{
\item{volume}{numeric 3d array, voxels which should not be plotted must have value `NA`. Take care not to plot too many.}

\item{max_render}{integer, the maximal number of voxels to render. If there are more voxels in the volume which are not `NA`, a warning will be issued and the rest will not be rendered. Set to `prod(dim(volume))` to allow to render all, but be aware that this may take ages.}

\item{render_every}{integer, how many to skip before rendering the next one. Set to 1 to render an object at every voxel.}

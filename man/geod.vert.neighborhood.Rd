\title{Compute all vertices within given geodesic distance on the mesh.}
\usage{
geod.vert.neighborhood(mesh, vertex, max_distance = 5, include_max = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{mesh}{an instance of \code{rgl::tmesh3d} or \code{freesurferformats::fs.surface}.}

\item{vertex}{positive integer (or vector of the latter), the index of the source vertex in the mesh. If a vector, the neighborhoods for all vertices will be computed separately.}

\item{max_distance}{double, the neighborhood size. All mesh vertices in geodesic distance smaller than / up to this distance will be returned.}

\item{include_max}{logical, whether the max_distance value is inclusive.}
}
\value{
integer vector, the indices of all vertices in the neigborhood.
}
\description{
Compute all vertices within given geodesic distance on the mesh.
}
\note{
This function uses the pseudo-geodesic distance along the mesh edges.
